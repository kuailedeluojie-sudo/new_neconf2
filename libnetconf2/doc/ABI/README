libnetconf2 ABI/API changes
===========================

Here is a script to build information about changes in libnetconf2 ABI/API
between its versions. Such an overview can help developers migrating from
one version to another. The script uses Andrey Ponomarenko's tools from ABI
Laboratory [1], so it is necessary to install these tools first. To do so,
you can use the automatic installer from [2]. Target must be 'abi-tracker'.

Note: Some others tools are used by the LVC toolset and not all of them are
      correctly checked, so be carefull and check warnings and error
      messages (e.g. I have been missing correct version of ctags).

Then here is the 'abi.sh' to build ABI/API timeline for libnetconf2. By default
it includes all the versions from the project start to the current devel
branch.

You can limit the number of included libnetconf2 versions via a number given
as a parameter to the script. For example

$ ./abi.sh 10

builds overview for the last 10 libnetconf2 versions.

Or you can compare only two specific libnetconf2 versions providing the version
numbers as script parameters:

$ ./abi.sh 0.1.0 0.2.3

The result is in all cases stored as 'timeline/libnetconf2/index.html' file.
